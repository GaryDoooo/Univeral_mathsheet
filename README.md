# Math Problem Generator

A web based application using LATEX, Python and JavaScript. My previous mathsheet generater can just do simple +-x/ two number calculation. Though it's good to practice proficiency of calculation. But it won't provide any algebra training. This new generator will use more sepecific modules to generate each type of questions. The math equations are generated by LATEX, which is compatible to much broader type of math problems.

The goal is to build a universal front end and server end. To expand different type of math problems will just need build more standard modules.
