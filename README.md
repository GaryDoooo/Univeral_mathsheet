# Math Problem Generator

The program generates math problems for kids, and sends answers to an email account. In current version, it can generate a number add (substract, multiply or divide) another number. Email address, number of questions, how many digits each number has and the operator can be set by options. 

The program will also count down time. When time is up, the problems will be cleared from the screen.
